# {{ $page.frontmatter.title }}

We've been introducing ourselves to a lot of folks from around ESDC this week. When we tell people we're a Code for Canada fellowship team, we're often met with a blank stare. Which is totally fair! But we thought it might help to make a video to introduce ourselves, and our mission, to our stakeholders and ESDC and beyond.

We collaborated on this video with Team Babel, our sister C4C team at ESDC.
