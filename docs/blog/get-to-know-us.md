title: "Get To Know Us!"

We've been introducing ourselves to a lot of folks from around ESDC this week. When we tell people we're a Code for Canada fellowship team, we're often met with a blank stare. So we made a video to introduce ourselves, and our mission, to our stakeholders in ESDC and beyond.

We collaborated on this video with Team Babel, our C4C sister team at ESDC.
