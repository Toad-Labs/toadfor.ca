# Hello, World

## Nice to meet you!

We are one of the four 2020 Code for Canada fellowship teams. To keep things simple, we’ve decided to call ourselves TOAD for Canada, or Totally On-board to Advance Digital for Canada. The members of TOAD are: Neil Mispelaar (Developer), Thomas Hoy (UX Design) and Farwa Farshori (Product Manager).

We are working with Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), at the Digital Futures and Foundations Accelerator. We’ll be bringing our knowledge of agile development, human-centered design and product management into our work with the Accelerator.

## Why is your blog so ugly?

First of all, rude! 

Secondly, we wanted to show what agile development and working in the open looks like. It means that we build in small chunks, and we show our progress along the way. We’re not going to wait until it’s finished, because truthfully, no technology project is ever finished. If you join us on this journey, hopefully, you’ll find that our blog, and its content, is improving with each iteration!

If you’re interested in the work we’re doing, or you have any feedback, please don’t hesitate to reach out! You can reach Farwa at <farwa.farshori@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca>, Thomas at <thomas.hoy@servicecanada.gc.ca>, or Neil at <neil.mispelaar@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca>.
