Take a look at this chatbot. Pretty standard stuff, right? And as you'd expect, when you speak to it, it speaks back. It's actually fairly impressive - it seems to understand what you're saying, and can respond coherently. This actually might be the smartest chatbot you've ever spoken to!

Status: In Review

Hi there! 

We are Team TOAD: Totally Onboard to Advance Digital. We are part of the 5th cohort of fellows at Code For Canada (C4C), a national nonprofit that embeds digital professionals within the government to deliver better digital services and build digital capacity. For the next ten months, we will be collaborating with the Digital Futures and Foundations Accelerator (DFFA) at Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) to develop user-centred digital services. 

Follow along our journey through these next 10 months as we develop and build the Virtual Concierge. 

**The Background** 

ESDC delivers various programs and services to a broad spectrum of clients, including some of the most well-known programs in Canada such as:

- Old Age Security / Guaranteed Income Supplement
- Canada Pension Plan
- Employment Insurance
- Canada Student Loans & Grants
- Canada Education Savings Program (RESPs)

ESDC anticipates that the way Canadians will want to access public services will significantly change in the coming years as the use of emerging technologies -- like AI, virtual reality, and voice-first services -- become the norm.

ESDC seeks to better understand future state user experiences and implications and design/prototype experiences for government services that will leverage emerging technologies to enhance Canadiansâ€™ public participation in, and autonomy over, the benefits system, i.e. creating a government as a platform service/solution.

**The Virtual Concierge** 

We have defined the virtual concierge as "something that helps navigate clients through complexity". As we explore the use of emerging technologies, we recognize that this concierge could take many forms from AR to chatbots. Team TOAD will be mapping what the ideal virtual concierge will look like 50 years from now and create a roadmap that will enable us to leverage existing technologies to build that ideal future.
