title: "Speculative Design Sprint"

## A Call to Action

Team Toad is working on a “future concierge”.  To help us understand what a "future concierge" is, We’re running a “speculative design sprint”.  This sprint will help us understand what a “good” concierge would be in an optimistic future 50 years from now. It will run over the course of 2 weeks - we'll begin with little more than a big challenge and a multidisciplinary team, and we'll end with a user-tested protytpe... ***fRoM tHe FuTuRe***

If this sounds weird to you, you're not alone! We are trying an unconventional approach, and it's taking us into uncharted territory. 

## We Need Your Help!

When we say we're putting together a multidisciplinary team, we're talking about you! We'd like you to join us, for 2 hours/day from Jan 18-21 and Jan 25-28.

## Why not use a more conventional approach?

Most future state mapping starts with identifying current client pain points, and then ideating solutions to address those pain points.

That’s a really powerful approach, but it has downsides. It’s fundamentally reactive; all proposed future states are a reaction to the problems of the day. It’s also fundamentally iterative. That’s normally a word that we like, because incremental improvement is at the heart of our agile practices. But incremental improvement is not innovation. To truly modernize our approach to benefit delivery we have to be innovative, which means thinking beyond 6 months or 1 year or even 5 years into the future.
